## Introduction
It was probably 1–2 months ago when I first saw the original tiktok posting that Mick Fleetwood famously recreated. I was doing my usual bedtime routine, aimlessly scrolling through TikTok looking to be entertained. When I landed on user's post, it didn't really strike me as anything special at first; no fancy choreophed dance, no jokes, no famous celebrity (yet)…just a guy cruising down the street on a skateboard, drinking Ocean Spray cranberry juice straight out of the carton - all while filming himself for his TikTok followers. But there was something about Stevie Nicks' cool, breezy voice that emphasized 420doggface208's carefree attitude, which I think helped resonate with nearly 5 million viewers. On a platform that is dominated by pop and hip-hop songs, the interesting question here is: How does a 42 year-old classic rock song break streaming records on a platform used mostly by kids who weren't even born when the song was first released?
