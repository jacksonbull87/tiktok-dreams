<!-- ## Introduction

Summer is typically an exciting time for music fans; as the days get longer and the temperature 
starts to heat up, positive and lively new music releases provide the perfect soundtrack 
to BBQs, trips to the beach, roadtrips, blockparties, and other forms of real life escapism.
Using data from TikTok's weekly music charts, the goal of this project is to examine the most
popular songs as defined by the following KPIs:
- Longevity (Time Spent on Chart)
- Velocity (Biggest Change in Rank Over a 7-Day Period) -->
<!-- - Spotify Popularity (Biggest Increase in Popularity Score)
